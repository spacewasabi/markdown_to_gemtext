# markdown_to_gemtext

In this folder, you can find a script written to generate gemtext from markdown. It's just a test, since it's only going to convert the file extension after parsing the markdown file then writing the gemtext into a new file. This script will need to be updated so the markdown syntax also gets updated as gemini syntax, which I am not sure to be capable of doing right now.

If you want to give it a shot, please fork this repository and try to do it, then you can create a pull request so I can update the script and this documentation accordingly.

As of now, if you want to run the script, make sure you have a recent version of node installed then run the following command :

```shell
node path/to/md_to_gmi.js example.md
```
